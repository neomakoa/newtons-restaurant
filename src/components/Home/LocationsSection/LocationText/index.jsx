        The interior of Newton's restaurants boasts a palette of muted
        tones, soft lighting, and tasteful decor that exudes understated
        opulence. From the plush upholstery to the carefully chosen
        artwork adorning the walls, each element has been selected to
        create a harmonious visual symphony. Enhancing the ambiance is
        the soft melody of live music, carefully curated to complement
        the dining experience without overpowering conversation. Our
        live musicians add an extra layer of sophistication to your
        evening.
